## Questions

- what happens when you add a new Todo item?
- how does it get to the redux store?
- where does the redux store save it?
- what happens on start up?

Note:
The students should open **React & Redux** DevTools and look at **ACTIONS** that **DISPATCH** between the application and the store. Also the students should find the new items being saved in the store.
